## Week 5 - Current, Fisher-Yates Shuffle
This week we looked at numerical algorithms, one of which was the Fisher-Yates Shuffle.
The Fisher-Yates algorithm iterates through an array in reverse by starting at the last element.  

We pick an random element (0 to n-1), and then swap it with the current index.
Our current index is now n-1 which is what we bound our random number's MAX to. We repeat this process
until we reach element 0.

Within 'FileImportToShuffle' is an example of the Fisher-Yates Shuffle
